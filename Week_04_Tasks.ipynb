    "### Scenario\n",
    "Greenfield Municipality requires a visual representation of the water level in its small-scale reservoir tank. You've been asked to create a simplified IoT prototype using LEDs to indicate the current state of the reservoir, simulating both filling (ascending) and draining (descending) sequences.\n",
    "### Operational Description:\n",
    "A sequence of LEDs represents the water level inside the tower. The LEDs will light sequentially from the bottom to the top, indicating the tank is filling, and then in reverse direction, indicating draining. This visual feedback helps technicians and municipality staff quickly assess tank operations and ensure proper functionality.\n",
