    "## Building an Interactive Memory-Based Game\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a memory-based game using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The game has four LEDs and four buttons, each corresponding to a unique tone. The system generates a sequence of tones and LED flashes that players must memorise and replicate using the buttons. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the sequence length increases. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, a \"game-over\" melody is played, and the system resets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "### 1.\tHardware Setup:\n",
    "üÖ∞Ô∏è Assemble and connect the following components on a breadboard:\n",
