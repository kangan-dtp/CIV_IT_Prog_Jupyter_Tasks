    "## Building an Interactive Memory-Based Game\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a memory-based game using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The game has four LEDs and four buttons, each corresponding to a unique tone. The system generates a sequence of tones and LED flashes that players must memorise and replicate using the buttons. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the sequence length increases. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, a \"game-over\" melody is played, and the system resets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "### 1.\tHardware Setup:\n",
    "🅰️ Assemble and connect the following components on a breadboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ➡️ Four LEDs (different colours for clarity).\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ➡️ Four buttons \n",
    "   \n",
    "    ➡️ One passive buzzer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ➡️ Raspberry Pi Pico.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ➡️ Jumper wires for connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.\tProgramming:\n",
    "\n",
    "🅱️ Program the microcontroller using MicroPython to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ➡️ Randomly generate and play an increasing sequence of tones and LED flashes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ➡️ Capture user inputs through button presses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➡️ Compare user inputs with the generated sequence and provide real-time feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ➡️ Play a \"game-over\" melody and reset the game if a mistake is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.\tGame Logic:\n",
    "⏩ Sequence progression: Increase sequence length as the game advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "⏩ Error detection: Reset the game when incorrect user input is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.\tPlayers should also:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ➡️ Enter their name at the start in Terminal or Console.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➡️ See real-time score updates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➡️ Be able to play multiple times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➡️ View the top 5 scores in a leaderboard stored in leaderboard.txt.\n",
