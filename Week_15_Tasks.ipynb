    "**1. RFID Login Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Each user (e.g., shelter staff or volunteer) must log in using an RFID tag.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Only registered users can proceed to the next step.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ You must create a MicroPython-based program for the Raspberry Pi Pico to read RFID tags and match them with registered user IDs stored in Supabase.\n",
    "**2. Scan the Rabbit RFID Tag and Log Interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Once logged in, the user can scan a rabbit‚Äôs RFID tag.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Your system must log the scan event in Supabase, including:\n",
    "        o\tUser ID\n",
    "        o\tRabbit ID\n",
    "        o\tTimestamp\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Scan the rabbit‚Äôs RFID tag.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Prompt the user to select the type of interaction, such as:\n",
    "        o\tü•ï Feeding\n",
    "        o\tüßº Cleaning\n",
    "        o\tü©∫ Health Check\n",
    "        o\tü§ó Social Play\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Log this event in Supabase under the interactions table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**3. Design a 3D Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Design a functional 3D-printable case to house the RFID reader and microcontroller.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Include slots or ports for:\n",
    "        o\tRFID reader antenna\n",
    "        o\tUSB/power cable\n",
    "        o\tIndicator LEDs or display (if used)\n",
    "**4. Print & Assemble the Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Use a 3D printer to produce the case.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Assemble all components neatly inside the printed enclosure.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Ensure the RFID reader can reliably scan cards while mounted.\n",
    "**5. Create a Web App**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Connect your web app to Supabase via its API.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Show:\n",
    "        o\tUsername\n",
    "        o\tRabbit name or ID\n",
    "        o\tInteraction type\n",
    "        o\tDate and time\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Add filter/search by:\n",
    "        o\tDate\n",
    "        o\tUser\n",
    "        o\tRabbit\n",
    "        o\tInteraction type\n",
    "**6. Group Presentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Demonstrate login + rabbit interaction + database entry.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Show web app with real-time data.\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Explain team roles and what each member worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üß© Bonus Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ‚Ä¢ Allow users to add comments during interaction (e.g., ‚ÄúRabbit seemed sick‚Äù).\n",
