    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "Your task today is to develop a complete RFID identification and tracking system for a rabbit shelter. This system will allow staff and volunteers to log in using RFID user tags, scan RFID rabbit tags, and record the type of interaction (e.g., feeding, cleaning, health check) to a Supabase database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team will also design, 3D print a case, and build a web app to display this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Tasks\n",
    "**1. RFID Login Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Each user (e.g., shelter staff or volunteer) must log in using an RFID tag.\n",
    "    • Only registered users can proceed to the next step.\n",
    "    • You must create a MicroPython-based program for the Raspberry Pi Pico to read RFID tags and match them with registered user IDs stored in Supabase.\n",
    "**2. Scan the Rabbit RFID Tag and Log Interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Once logged in, the user can scan a rabbit’s RFID tag.\n",
    "    • Your system must log the scan event in Supabase, including:\n",
    "        o\tUser ID\n",
    "        o\tRabbit ID\n",
    "        o\tTimestamp\n",
    "    • Scan the rabbit’s RFID tag.\n",
    "    • Prompt the user to select the type of interaction, such as:\n",
    "        o\tFeeding\n",
    "        o\tCleaning\n",
    "        o\tHealth Check\n",
    "        o\tSocial Play\n",
    "    • Log this event in Supabase under the interactions table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**3. Design a 3D Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Design a functional 3D-printable case to house the RFID reader and microcontroller.\n",
    "    • Include slots or ports for:\n",
    "        o\tRFID reader antenna\n",
    "        o\tUSB/power cable\n",
    "        o\tIndicator LEDs or display (if used)\n",
    "**4. Print & Assemble the Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Use a 3D printer to produce the case.\n",
    "    • Assemble all components neatly inside the printed enclosure.\n",
    "    • Ensure the RFID reader can reliably scan cards while mounted.\n",
    "**5. Create a Web App**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Connect your web app to Supabase via its API.\n",
    "    • Show:\n",
    "        o\tUsername\n",
    "        o\tRabbit name or ID\n",
    "        o\tInteraction type\n",
    "        o\tDate and time\n",
    "    • Add filter/search by:\n",
    "        o\tDate\n",
    "        o\tUser\n",
    "        o\tRabbit\n",
    "        o\tInteraction type\n",
    "**6. Group Presentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Demonstrate login + rabbit interaction + database entry.\n",
    "    • Show web app with real-time data.\n",
    "    • Explain team roles and what each member worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Allow users to add comments during interaction (e.g., “Rabbit seemed sick”).\n",
    "    • Display rabbit profiles with interaction history on the web app.\n"
