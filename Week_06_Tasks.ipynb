    "## Task 1: LED Signal Control System\n",
    "You are designing a factory alert system that uses four LEDs to represent different statuses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Red LED: Emergency\n",
    "    It blinks slowly for  5 seconds to signal an emergency stop.\n",
    "2. Green LED: Operation Normal\n",
    "    Blinks slowly for  5 seconds to indicate normal operation.\n",
    "3. Blue LED: System Cooling\n",
    "    Blinks slowly 5 times (0.5 seconds on, 0.5 seconds off) to show the active cooling system.\n",
    "4. Yellow LED: Maintenance Required\n",
    "    Blinks quickly 5 times (0.5 seconds on, 0.5 seconds off) to signal a maintenance alert.\n",
    "The LEDs should activate in sequence and repeat continuously.\n",
    "### Code Requirements\n",
    "1. Use of Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Store the GPIO pins and LED colour names in lists for better organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Create a reusable function for blinking an LED a specified number of times with a specified delay.\n",
    "3. Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Use loops to:\n",
    "\n",
    "        >> Iterate over the list of LEDs.\n",
    "        >> Blink LEDs as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Requriment\n",
    " 1. Breadbord\n",
    " 2. LED lights( Red, Green, Yellow and Blue)\n",
    " 3. Pi Pico\n",
    " 4. Jumper wires\n"
