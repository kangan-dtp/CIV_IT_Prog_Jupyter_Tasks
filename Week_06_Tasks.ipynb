    "## Task 1: Smooth LED Brightness Controller\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "As a Junior Developer at TechVision Kids, you are part of an exciting initiative to help young students learn about electronics and coding. A local school has approached us to create a fun and educational activity that teaches students how Analog inputs and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) work together.\n",
    "Your task is to prototype a simple MicroPython-based project that allows users to control the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer. This hands-on demo will help students see how user input can dynamically affect real-time electronic components.\n",
    "##### Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Core Features (Must-Have):\n",
    "    1. Connect an LED to the appropriate GPIO on the Raspberry Pi Pico \n",
    "    2. Connect a potentiometer to the appropriate GPIO(ADC).\n",
    "    3. Use ADC to read the Analog value from the potentiometer.\n",
    "    4. Use PWM to control the LED’s brightness based on the potentiometer input.\n",
    "    5. Add a short delay in the loop to smooth the brightness transition.\n",
    "###### Make sure:\n",
    "    • The LED brightness increases or decreases smoothly as the potentiometer is turned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Your code is clear and commented.\n",
    "##### Helpful Tips:\n",
    "    • Use machine.ADC() is used to read the potentiometer input.\n",
    "    • Use machine.PWM() for output to the LED.\n",
    "    • PWM duty cycle on the Pico goes from 0 to 65535, so you might need to scale your ADC input accordingly.\n",
    "    • Use time.sleep() to add a delay in your main loop.\n",

    "## Task 2: LED Chase with Speed Control (Knight Rider Effect)\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "As part of our TechVision Kids STEM learning initiative, we’re designing an exciting hands-on activity that introduces students to Analog input, digital output, and real-time control using MicroPython.\n",
    "Previously, you built a project where a potentiometer controlled the brightness of an LED. Now, it’s time to take your skills up a notch!\n",
    "In this project, you'll use a potentiometer to control the speed of an LED chase animation. As the potentiometer is turned, the LEDs will light up faster or slower — giving students a real-time visual demonstration of how input from a sensor affects output behaviour.\n",

    "If you complete the core task early, try one or more of the following:\n",
    "    1. Add a button to toggle between forward chase, backward chase, or random pattern.\n",
    "    2. Print the current speed/delay value to the serial terminal.\n",

    "## Task 3: Colour Clash Reaction Challenge!\n",
    "### Scenario:\n",
    "You are working as a junior developer at TechVision Kids, a company creating educational games and electronic kits for schools. You’ve been assigned to create a fun and interactive memory and reflex game that combines electronics and MicroPython coding. The goal is to encourage students to practice colour recognition and hand-eye coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Your Task:\n",
    "Create a game called “Colour Clash Reaction Challenge.” Players must match the colour shown by pressing the correct button. They win and hear a victory melody if they match all 15 in a row. A mistake ends the game, plays a sad melody, and saves the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Players should also:\n",
    "    • Enter their name at the start in Terminal or Console.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • See real-time score updates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Be able to play multiple times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • View the top 5 scores in a leaderboard stored in leaderboard.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The game will:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Provide visual feedback using coloured LEDs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Use buttons to detect player input.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Play buzzer sounds for correct/incorrect answers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Save scores in a leaderboard file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Celebrate perfect scores with a melody.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Display top scores at the end of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • The game runs smoothly with colour-light and button-response logic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • RGB LEDs blink and match the selected colour.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Player input is accurately captured using buttons.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Correct answer plays a short beep; wrong answer plays a longer low-pitch tone.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Perfect score plays a Mario victory melody.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Score is saved with the player's name and shown in a leaderboard.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • The leaderboard file is readable and permanent and displays top scores.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#####  Extension Ideas:\n",
    "    1. Add a timer to track player reaction speed.\n",
